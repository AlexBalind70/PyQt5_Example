# PyQt5_Example
Hi everyone! 
In this repository, I am sharing my projects developed using the Pyqt5 framework. 
For each project, I will provide photos and GIF animations to help you understand what the programs are capable of. 
I publish these projects to share with you and demonstrate the potential of the Pyqt5 library for GUI. 
If you need detailed information on how to create programs, 
feel free to contact me at sashatatarnikov73@gmail.com, and I will be happy to assist you.

№1-LoginPage
The main window contains various functions and events to handle user actions. 
It has a custom user interface defined in the "login_UI.py" file using the Ui_MainWindow class.
The loginBtn_clicked function is called when the "loginButton" is clicked and checks the entered username and password. 
If the correct password ("0") and username "admin" are entered, a message displaying successful authentication is shown. 
Otherwise, a warning is displayed.
The startAnimation and stopAnimation functions are used to start and stop the animation on the label using QMovie.
The mouseMoveEvent, mousePressEvent, and mouseReleaseEvent functions handle mouse events. 
They allow the user to move the main window by clicking and dragging it with the left mouse button.
